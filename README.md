# Summary

We have developed a new variational framework to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that govern the flow of joint probability density functions of continuous time stochastic systems. This is a prototype solver for the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov PDE to simulate density propagation for  specialized 1D AND 2D systems. This new method propagates the joint PDF as probability-weighted scattered point cloud, and does not require function approximation or spatial discretization.

## How to use:
1. Download the folder [Codes] from GitHub.

2. Open MATLAB and make sure you're in the right directory.

3. Open Main.m and change parameters and initial conditions.
